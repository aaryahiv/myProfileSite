My name is Aaryahi Vaidya and I am 15 years old. I've had a dog for the past seven years and I am able to properly handle dogs with care and discipline.

Additionally, I am also a singer/songwriter and a coder. To get a glimpse of my musical work and coding skills, check out some of the links below of my videos, social media, and GitHub account.
