**Service**

Considering the difficult times during this global pandemic and lockdown, I have decided to provide help and service to ones with dogs. Any person or families in which walking the dog is a difficult task right now, I am here to help. With my prior and current experience of living with a dog and knowing how to handle many dogs, I will be able to walk the dogs. Though I have certain policies as per handling the dogs and their nature, I hope that this will bring attention to families with dogs in need of help and assistance.


Policies

The following are policies I have pertaining this service I am providing.

1. You must live in the town of Milpitas in California.    
2. Your dog must be well-trained(He/she should not attack strangers).  
3. You must provide the harness and leash for your dog.  
4. I will have 30-minute time slots provided for the service.  
5. Your dog must understand simple commands such as stay or sit.
